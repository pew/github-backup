# github-backup

I didn't like all other github backup tools so I created my own (probably buggy) one. It'll just go through your public available github repos, this includes forks as well. If the repo was already backed up it'll just pull the changes.

# Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python application.py <username> <destDir>
```
